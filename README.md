# EPCryst - Solve crystal structure from powder diffraction data

> EPCryst is based on EPC algorithm which can generate trial structure models (TSM) based on unit cell contents and space group information. The most promising TSMs will be selected (by a serial of rules) and solved by global optimization algorithms.

## Features:
 - User friendly interface
 - Automatic trial structure generator 
 - Full control of trial structure generate process
 - Editable structure parameters
 - Multiple global optimization algorithms
  
## Framework
 Epcryst solve crystal structure in 3 main steps:
 - Generate trail structures
 - Select candidate strucutures
 - Solve crystal structure using global optimization method

## Tutorial
Epcryst has user friendly user interface and the usage is straight forward. You can view examples shipped within the installer for preparing the input files. Furthermore, here is a detailed tutorial give you the basic concept how Epcryst works.
